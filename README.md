Binary search trees from Odin Project

This task taught me binary trees and how to work with them. It also solidified my knowledge on recursion.

**Important topics**:

- Balanced vs Unbalanced
- Breadth-First Traversal (level order)
- Depth-First Traversal (pre-order, post-order, in-order)
- Recursion
